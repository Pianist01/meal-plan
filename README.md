# meal-plan

This project is meant to a be a simple version of calorie calculator. After asking the user a series of questions regarding their name, age, weight, height, and what they want to achieve weight-wise, a new page is created organizing the data. Their own meal plan is created along with displaying the the calories needed to achieve their goal. In addition to this, it also gives a reccomendation of foods the user can eat in order to achieve their goal.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

For this project I leaned heavily on JavaScript in order to generate the majority of the elements shown on screen, along with how the website functions as well. However, in addition to JavaScript, I also used HTML and CSS. HTML was used to simply have a foundation for the entire page, and everything would then be generated once the button was clicked using JavaScript. CSS was used to style the website, along with creatinga a small loading animation in between pages 2 and 3.
